```python

# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

# Function to do insertion sort
def insertionSort(arr):

    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):

        key = arr[i]

        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        # greater than key, to one position ahead
        # of their current position
        j = i-1
        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j+1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key


# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertionSort(arr)
print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i])
